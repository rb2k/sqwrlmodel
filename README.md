# sqwrlmodel
These files are the result of a weekeend project in October 2020 to detect squirrels in our backyard.
It's a set of tensorflow lite models that can detect squirrels (and "person, dog, cat, bird").
I used them with [DOODS](https://github.com/snowzach/doods/) and the Coral AI USB Accelerator 

Model 1: Total images = 675
Model 2: Total images = 2,924
